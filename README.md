Tic-Tac-Two â€“ JS / TS / Vue Practice

This repo contains three simple implementations of the game Tic-Tac-Two, built using: JavaScript, TypeScript
and Vue (with TypeScript).

The goal of this project was to explore the differences in writing code with plain JS, TS, and Vue + TS. 
Because of that, the games are nearly identical in structure and logic â€” the main visual difference is the color theme for each version.
